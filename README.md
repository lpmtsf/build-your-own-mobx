# Build your own MobX

Explore different approaches to state management in React and see how does MobX work under the hood.

Change branches to see the different example:

## master

No state management.

## option-1-useState

Manage state using `useState` hook. 

option-2-useContext

Manage state using `useContext` hook. 

option-3-mobx

A simple example of how to use Mobx.

option-4-botx

Same example as above, but this time we replace MobX with... BotX!

option-4.1-botx-with-components

BotX in action with more complex structure.


Have fun!
